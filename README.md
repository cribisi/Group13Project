CSCI 3308 Spring 17 project

Team Name:Hound Dogs

Members: Chad Ribisi, Fernando Mercado, Lucas Sward, Mahalia Evans, Xi Gao

Description: Our project will be a dating app similar to tinder meant for people with or without dogs to meet other people with dogs. The reasoning behind this is to provide an environment for people who are only looking for someone with a dog. With tinder there may be someone only looking to date someone for their dog. With that situation, there are already hidden motives, and our app will get rid of those hidden motives. Essentially, if someone's first priority is to meet someone with a dog because they dont have a dog or they are looking for someone with a dog that can play with their dog, we can facilitate the environment where meeting those kinds of people is possible. In addition to being able to meet someone on the app that has a pet, there could also be an option for people strictly looking for playmates for their pets. 

Vision Statement: Facilitate a friendly environment for pets or people to find a special someone.
Motivation: We have seen/used other dating apps such as tinder and feel that there is no representation for those people who like dogs/animals. We also considered people who can't own dogs themselves, but is single and wanting to date a dog owner. There's lots of dating sites and apps out there and we think that our app will add some creativity and options to that pool.

Risks:
  Lucas- No experience developing apps, no experience in java which I believe is what we would use to make the app. Not a huge amount of programming experience in general. Only languages I know are c++, matlab, and c.
    General Problems- maybe lack of access to a server to store photos of people using the app.
    
Risk Mitigation Plan:
  Lucas- Willing to learn java, I can get access to an android phone emulator to test the sofware on. I can easily find open source resources to learn how to develop an android app.
Version Control: We will be using Github to version control our mobile application.

Development Method: Agile method?? 

Collaboration Tool: Currently we are using Facebook Messenger and Google docs to communicate and collabarate. This allows for all us to quickly message the others and a platform where we can express our ideas and the others can add to it.
