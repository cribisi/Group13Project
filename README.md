CSCI 3308 Spring 17 project

Team Name:Hound Dogs

Members: Chad Ribisi, Fernando Mercado, Lucas Sward, Mahalia Evans, Xi Gao

Description: Our project will be a application for people with or without dogs to meet other people with dogs. The reasoning behind this is to provide an environment for people who are only looking for someone with a dog.  Essentially, if someone's first priority is to meet someone with a dog because they dont have a dog or they are looking for someone with a dog that can play with their dog, we can facilitate the environment where meeting those kinds of people is possible. In addition to being able to meet someone on the app that has a pet, there could also be an option for people strictly looking for playmates for their pets. 

Vision Statement: Facilitate a friendly environment for people to find a furry friend.

Motivation: As college students, we are constantly stressed out for exams and finals and its been shown in studies that animals can alieveate this stress. We say this and wanted to create an app to create a safe environment for people with animals to be used as therapy animals. We also say this as a way for pet owners to meet an allow for thier animals to play and socialize. We also saw the benefit of allowing students to remember their pets from home, helping with homesickness.

Risks: <br />
* General Problems - May lack access to a server to store photos of people using the app. <br />
* Lucas - No experience developing apps, no experience in java which I believe is what we would use to make the app. Not a huge amount of programming experience in general. Only languages I know are c++, matlab, and c. <br  />
* Xi - Little to no experience developing apps. Not well versed in java, last time I used java was in high school. Not sure where to start for the app development. <br />
* Fernando - Limited experience developing apps, specially for Android and with Java. <br />
* Mahalia - No experience with Swift languaging and creation of such an intrecate application for IOS. <br  />
    
Risk Mitigation Plan: <br /> 
* Lucas - Willing to learn java, I can get access to an android phone emulator to test the sofware on. I can easily find open source resources to learn how to develop an android app. <br />
* Chad - Found that we can use c++ to code for both OS allowing for an easier time coding, without having to learn a new language. <br />
* Fernando - If we use C++ to do the apps, I will be able to put my experience to work and will help me work with Android. <br />
* Mahalia - Will learn Swift for the purpose of this project and future applications. Willing to learn other languges that can be applicable for the expansion of this project.  <br />
  
Version Control: We will be using Github to version control our mobile application. <br />
* Xi - Had learned java before, can probably pick it up relatively quickly. Can probably research where to start and will be able to build on that progress. * 

Development Method: Agile method in order to prioritize features and streamline our project.

Collaboration Tool: Currently we are using Facebook Messenger and Google docs to communicate and collabarate. This allows for all us to quickly message the others and a platform where we can express our ideas and the others can add to it. We will soon have Slack setup to further assist us in communicating our ideas between one another. We are now using Trello as the Project Management tool in order to keep track of the product backlog.
