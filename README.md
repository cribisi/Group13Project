CSCI 3308 Spring 17 project
Team Name:
Description:
Vision Statement:
Motivation: We have seen/used other dating apps such as tinder and feel that there is no representation for those people who like dogs/animals. We also considered people who can't own dogs themselves, but is single and wanting to date a dog owner. There's lots of dating sites and apps out there and we think that our app will add some creativity and options to that pool.
Risk Mitigation Plan:
Version Control: We will be using Github to version control our mobile application.
Development Control:
Collaboration: Currently we are using Facebook Messenger and Google docs to communicate and collabarate. This allows for all us to quickly message the others and a platform where we can express our ideas and the others can add to it.
