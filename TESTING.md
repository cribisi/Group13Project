Also, if the username and password fields are left blank throw error message saying you must enter a username and password.

Feature 2: Sign-up

If the incorrect values are added to the database, then it fails. If the correct username and password are entered into the database , then it passes. Also, the program should put out an error if the passwords entered donâ€™t match, or if either of the fields are left blank.

Feature 3: Map Location
